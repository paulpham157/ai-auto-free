### Cursor Account Creator
It's fully automatic. You don't need to do anything.

___
### Settings
Browser Visibility: By default, the browser is hidden while operations are being performed. If you want to see how automatic account creation processes are done, enable this option.

Email Verifier: By default, the "Temporary" option is selected. If this option is selected, it will perform email verification using temp mail services. However, since the services we create accounts for block temp mail services, there is a chance of encountering problems. In this case, you can select the "IMAP" option.

If the IMAP option is selected, it will perform email verification using IMAP services.
